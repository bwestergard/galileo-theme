Is it possible to be a Marxist today? Radical changes in occupational structure, the prevalence (if not preponderance) of "post-Fordist" work organization, and the near-total collapse of labor movements and socialist parties pose a challenge to relevance of the Marxian analysis and the viability Marxist political commitments. These notes are an effort to answer that challenge.

Between _Jacobin_ and the _Financial Times_, of-the-moment commentary on the social and political character of "the information society" and what this portends for established political ideologies can hardly be said to be in short supply. What am I hoping will be distinctive about this writing?

First, there is the matter of day-to-day perspective. I work as a software developer for a firm which services the logistics industry. When social theorists refer to "symbolic analysts" or "knowledge workers" who do "non-routine cognitive work" and together constitute a "creative class", they have in mind people like me. Likewise, the ongoing "logistics revolution" is widely seen as the sine qua non of a "globalized" contemporary capitalism. In these respects, the view from my niche in social division of labor ought to be of interest to others.

Second, I intend to take a longer view of the emergence of post-Fordism and the development of the information technologies thought to play a central role therein than is typical. Specifically, I believe an examination of the little-discussed history of semi-automatic computing and telecommunications methods can help us to see continuities between the eras putatively divided by the debut of the electronic, stored-program, general-purpose digital computer.

Finally, I'll draw on what might be termed the "Wittgensteinian" literature to tackle difficulties encountered in applying Marxian theories of value, the labor process, and technology to contemporary capitalism. In this connection, I believe Wittgenstein's engagement with Turing on the Church-Turing Thesis, von Wright's critique of methodological monism in the social and physical sciences, and Anscombe's theory of action can be fruitfully juxtaposed with Marxian theories with an eye to synthesis.

By way of a motto, I'll take this exhortation from Braverman, whose _Labor and Monopoly Capital_ will be a key point of reference in these posts:

> If the thought is right that the trouble lies not in original error but in uncorrected obsolescence, then the job is not to see where “Marx was wrong" so much as to make a fresh application of his theory to the world around us as it is, not as it once was. To borrow a comparison from the field of physics, we need socialist Faradays and Maxwell’s or if we are lucky, Einstein’s and Planck’s, not people who confine themselves to knocking Isaac Newton.

Even if I succeeded in playing the role of "socialist Faraday", I doubt this blog would garner much attention beyond my friends. But I think writing for an imagined public is as good a way as any to achieve clarity (C.f. Wittgenstein: "A philosopher who is not taking part in discussions is like a boxer who never goes into the ring."). If you find anything here of interest, or would just like to take a proverbial swing at me, don't hesitate to drop me a line at `bjornw [at] gmail [dot] com`.
