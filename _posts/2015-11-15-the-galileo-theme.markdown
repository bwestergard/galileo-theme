I work as a software engineer and my political sympathies are with the vestiges Marxist left. This puts me in an interesting position.

The set-pieces of socialist literature - agitation in fields, factories, and workshops, strikes and insurrections by workers and peasants - are alien to me. For the last several decades, the employment shares of high-wage jobs requiring a great deal of education and low-wage jobs requiring very little have grown as the share of middling jobs has shrunk, a phenomena known as "job polarization". My working life so far has played out on the rosy side of the ensuing occupational structure, where in addition to high pay I and most of my coworkers enjoy self-direction and intellectual stimulation which the vast majority of workers are denied.

Marxist theory has yet to adequately grapple with these conditions and their political consequences. As Braverman put it:

> "If the thought is right that the trouble lies not in original error but in uncorrected obsolescence, then the job is not to see where “Marx was wrong" so much as to make a fresh application of his theory to the world around us as it is, not as it once was. To borrow a comparison from the field of physics, we need socialist Faradays and Maxwell’s or if we are lucky, Einstein’s and Planck’s, not people who confine themselves to knocking Isaac Newton."

Classical Marxism distinguished itself from other socialist currents by its insistence that the industrial working class alone had the power to supersede the capitalist mode of production and overturn its social order. This orientation to the working class to some extent inoculated Marxists against utopianism: the temptation to derive, a priori, necessary features of the the society which was to follow. In the place of "ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer" Marxists were to "express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes".

As the manufacturing share of employment has declined internationally, so too have labor unions and labor-oriented political parties. This leaves those who find the critique of

At present, the paucity of "existing class struggle" or, what amounts to the same, the absence of a credible revolutionary agency
