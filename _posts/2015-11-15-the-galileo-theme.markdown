I work as a software engineer and my political sympathies are with the vestiges Marxist left. This puts me in an interesting position.

The set-pieces of socialist literature - fields, factories, and workshops, mass strikes and insurrections by industrial workers - are alien to me. My working life so far has played out on the rosy side of a "post-industrial" occupational profile, where I and most of my coworkers enjoy the high pay, self-direction, and intellectual stimulation which the vast majority of workers are denied. 

Marxist theory has yet to adequately grapple with this polarization and its political consequences. As Braverman put it:

> "If the thought is right that the trouble lies not in original error but in uncorrected obsolescence, then the job is not to see where “Marx was wrong" so much as to make a fresh application of his theory to the world around us as it is, not as it once was. To borrow a comparison from the field of physics, we need socialist Faradays and Maxwell’s or if we are lucky, Einstein’s and Planck’s, not people who confine themselves to knocking Isaac Newton."

Classical Marxism distinguished itself from other socialist currents by its insistence that the working class alone had the power to supersede the capitalist mode of production and overturn its social order. This orientation to the working class to some extent inoculated Marxists against utopianism: the temptation to derive, a priori, necessary features of the the society which was to follow. In the place of "ideas or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that would-be universal reformer" Marxists were to "express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very eyes".

The traditional institutions of working class activity - labor unions and labor-oriented political parties - have been in retreat for decades. Strike activity, the truest index of union vitality, has with few exceptions tapered off internationally. Left-wing political parties of all stripes have abandoned labor-oriented platforms, or seen their electoral fortunes suffer. The paucity of "existing class struggle" seems to leave open to those who remain dissatisfied with the present order only utopian escapism or acquiescence.

This blog is a place to collect and make available my notes on the history of technology, the political economy of technical change, the changing character of work, and attendant philosophical issues. These are broad fields. What am I hoping to accomplish here?
